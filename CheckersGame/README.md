# Simulation a Checkers game

## Progect Description
	The destination of this project is to make the desition of the next step and to make sure "my_player" has high probabilty of winning in this game.
	In this program, there are two mainly algorithm-minimax and alpha-beta prunning
	The language is python

## Problem Description
	 This game is played by two players, on opposite sides of the game board. The game is played on a                    board of fixed size 8x8.  One player has the Star pieces; the other has the Circle pieces. Player Star plays from the bottom of the board to the top and player Circle plays from the top of the board to the bottom.
	Players alternate turns.When it is a player’s turn (say player Star’s turn), it can do one of the following:
	1- Move one of its pieces diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square on the next row. See figure below.
	2- If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it (diagonally) is vacant, the opponent’s piece can be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it. See figures below.
	3- Pass the move to the other player. A player can only pass if it cannot move any of its pieces.
