###Draw Rules:

(From Wikipedia)

The draw for the 2018 FIFA World Cup will take place on 1 December 2017 at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow, Russia. It will determine the group in which each of the 32 qualified national teams will play in at the start of the tournament. The teams will be divided into four pots of eight, with one team selected from each pot to form a group.

Unlike previous editions of the World Cup, all pots will be determined by each national team's October 2017 FIFA World Ranking, with Pot 1 containing the highest-ranked teams, Pot 2 containing the next highest-ranked teams, and so on; in previous editions only one pot containing the highest-ranked teams was determined by rank, with the other three pots determined by continental confederation. The hosts will continue to be placed in Pot 1 and treated as a seeded team, therefore, Pot 1 will consist of hosts Russia and the seven highest-ranked teams that qualify for the tournament.

As with previous editions, no group may have more than one team from any continental confederation with the exception of UEFA, which may have no more than two in a group.
